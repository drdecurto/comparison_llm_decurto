        "To solve this problem, we'll use calculus to find the maximum area of the rectangular enclosure. Here are the steps:\n\n**Step 1: Define the variables and constraints**\n\nLet's call the length of the enclosure (parallel to the river) \"L\" and the width \"W\". Since the farmer has 100 meters of fencing, we know that the total length of fencing used is equal to the sum of the widths of the two sides perpendicular to the river, plus the length of the side parallel to the river (which doesn't require fencing). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n2W + L = 100\n\n**Step 2: Express the area of the enclosure in terms of one variable**\n\nThe area of the enclosure (A) is given by:\n\nA = L \u00d7 W\n\nWe can use the constraint equation from Step 1 to express L in terms of W:\n\nL = 100 - 2W\n\nSubstituting this expression for L into the area equation, we get:\n\nA = (100 - 2W) \u00d7 W\n= 100W - 2W^2\n\n**Step 3: Find the maximum area using calculus**\n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to find the critical points of the area function.
