We want to find the maximum height it will reach, ignoring air resistance. The acceleration due to gravity (g) is 9.8 m/s\u00b2, which acts downward.\n\n**Step 2: Choose the relevant equation of motion**\n\nSince the ball is under constant acceleration (due to gravity), we can use the following equation:\n\nv\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as\n\nwhere:\nv = final velocity (at the highest point, v = 0)\nu = initial velocity (20 m/s)\na = acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/s\u00b2, negative because it's downward)\ns = displacement (height) from the initial position\n\n**Step 3: Plug in the values and solve for s**\n\nAt the highest point, the velocity (v) is 0, so we can plug in the values:\n\n0\u00b2 = 20\u00b2 + 2(-9.8)s\n0 = 400 - 19.6s\n\nNow, solve for s:\n\n19.6s = 400\ns = 400 / 19.6\ns = 20.41 m\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the result**\n\nThe ball will reach a maximum height of approximately 20.41 meters above the initial position.\n\nTherefore, the answer",

We need to find out how high it will go, ignoring air resistance. The acceleration due to gravity (g) is given as 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\n### Step 2: Recall Relevant Equations\nThe equation for the height (h) of an object under constant acceleration (in this case, gravity) is given by:\n\\[ h = v_0t + \\frac{1}{2}at^2 \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(h\\) is the height,\n- \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity (20 m/s in this case),\n- \\(t\\) is the time,\n- \\(a\\) is the acceleration (for an object under gravity, \\(a = -g = -9.8\\) m/s\u00b2, negative because it acts opposite to the initial upward velocity).\n\nHowever, since we're looking for the maximum height and not the height at a specific time, we'll use another approach that involves the velocity at the highest point being zero.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Concept of Maximum Height\nAt the maximum height, the velocity of the ball will be zero because it momentarily stops before falling back down. We can use the equation:\n\\[ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2as \\]\nwhere:\n"

Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the possible genotypes of the parents**\n\nThe ABO blood group system is controlled by a single gene with three alleles: A, B, and O. The A and B alleles are codominant, while the O allele is recessive.\n\n* The genotype of the first parent is AO, which means they have one A allele and one O allele.\n* The genotype of the second parent is BO, which means they have one B allele and one O allele.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the possible genotypes of the child**\n\nTo find the possible genotypes of the child, we need to consider the alleles that each parent can contribute. Each parent can contribute either the A or O allele (from the AO parent) or the B or O allele (from the BO parent).\n\n* The possible genotypes of the child are:\n\t+ AO (if the child inherits the A allele from the AO parent and the O allele from the BO parent)\n\t+ BO (if the child inherits the B allele from the BO parent and the O allele from the AO parent)\n\t+ AB (if the child inherits the A allele from the AO parent and the B allele from the BO parent)\n\t+ OO (if the child inherits the O allele from both parents)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the probability of each genotype**\n\nSince",
        "To solve this problem, we need to understand the genetics of the ABO blood group system. The ABO blood group system is controlled by a single gene with three alleles: A, B, and O. The A and B alleles are codominant, while the O allele is recessive. \n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Determine the genotypes and phenotypes of the parents:**\n   - Parent 1 has the genotype AO. This means they have one A allele and one O allele. Since A is codominant over O, the phenotype of Parent 1 is A.\n   - Parent 2 has the genotype BO. This means they have one B allele and one O allele. Since B is codominant over O, the phenotype of Parent 2 is B.\n\n2. **Determine the possible genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring:**\n   - To find the possible genotypes of the offspring, we need to consider all possible combinations of alleles that the child can inherit from the parents.\n   - Parent 1 (AO) can contribute either an A or an O allele.\n   - Parent 2 (BO) can contribute either a B or an O allele.\n   - Therefore, the possible genotypes of the offspring are:\n     - AO (inheriting A from Parent 1 and O from Parent 2)\n     - BO (inheriting B from Parent 2 and O from Parent 1)\n    "

        "To explain the role of mRNA in protein synthesis, let's break down the process step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Introduction to mRNA**\nmRNA, or messenger RNA, is a type of RNA molecule that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. It is a single-stranded molecule that is complementary to one of the DNA strands in the genome.\n\n**Step 2: Transcription**\nThe process of creating mRNA from DNA is called transcription. During transcription, an enzyme called RNA polymerase reads the template DNA strand and matches the incoming nucleotides to the base pairing rules (A-T and G-C). The resulting mRNA molecule is complementary to the template DNA strand.\n\n**Step 3: mRNA Structure**\nThe mRNA molecule has several key features:\n\t* A 5' cap: a modified guanine nucleotide that protects the mRNA from degradation\n\t* A 3' poly-A tail: a long sequence of adenine nucleotides that helps stabilize the mRNA\n\t* Coding regions: sequences of nucleotides that encode amino acids\n\t* Non-coding regions: sequences of nucleotides that do not encode amino acids\n\n**Step 4: Translation**\nThe mRNA molecule travels out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where it is translated into a protein.
