        "Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the given information\nWe are given a 5 kg block being pulled up a rough incline with an angle of 30 degrees. The pulling force is 50 N parallel to the plane, and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.2. We need to find the work done by the pulling force over a distance of 4 meters.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the work done by the pulling force\nWork is defined as the product of force and displacement in the direction of the force. In this case, the pulling force is parallel to the plane, so we can directly multiply the force and the distance to find the work done.\n\nWork = Force x Distance\nWork = 50 N x 4 m\nWork = 200 J\n\nSo, the work done by the pulling force over 4 meters is 200 Joules.",

This can be calculated using the formula F_gravity_parallel = F_gravity * sin(\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle of the incline.\n\nF_gravity_parallel = 49.05 N * sin(30\u00b0) = 24.525 N\n\nStep 4: Calculate the force of kinetic friction\nThe force of kinetic friction can be calculated using the formula F_friction = \u03bck * F_normal, where \u03bck is the coefficient of kinetic friction and F_normal is the normal force. The normal force is equal to the component of the force of gravity perpendicular to the incline, which can be calculated using the formula F_normal",
