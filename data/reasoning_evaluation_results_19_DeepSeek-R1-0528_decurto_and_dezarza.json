The key point is that at the maximum height, the velocity is zero.\n\nSo, I can use the equations of motion for constant acceleration. Since gravity is constant, that should work. The acceleration due to gravity is downward, so when the ball is going up, acceleration is negative if I take upward as positive.\n\nLet me define the direction. I'll take the upward direction as positive. So, initial velocity, u, is +20 m/s. Acceleration, a, is due to gravity, and since it's downward, a = -g = -9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nAt the maximum height, final velocity, v, is 0 m/s.\n\nI need to find the height, which is the displacement, s.\n\nThe equation that relates initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and displacement is:\n\nv\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as\n\nYes, that should work because I don't have time involved.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nv = 0\n\nu = 20 m/s\n\na ="
