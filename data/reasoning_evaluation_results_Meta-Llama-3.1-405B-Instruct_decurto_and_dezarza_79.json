We're given that 75% of the population have dark wings (DD or Dd) and 25% have light wings (dd).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the frequency of the recessive allele (q)**\n\nSince 25% of the population have light wings (dd), the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is the square root of 0.25:\n\nq = \u221a0.25 = 0.5\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the frequency of the dominant allele (p)**\n\nSince the frequencies of the two alleles must add up to 1, we can calculate the frequency of the dominant allele (p) as:\n\np = 1 - q = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nHowever, we know that 75% of the population have dark wings, which means that the frequency of the dominant allele is actually higher than 0.5. Let's recalculate the frequency of the recessive allele (q) and then the dominant allele (p).\n\nLet's denote the frequency of the light-winged moths as q^2 = 0.25. Then, q = \u221a0.25 = 0",

The equation for acceleration (a) in SHM is given by:\n   a(t) = -A\u03c9^2 cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6)\n   Since we want to find the maximum acceleration, we can ignore the cosine term and the negative sign, and simply use the following equation:\n   a_max = A\u03c9^2\n\nStep 4: Plug in the values for A and \u03c9 into the equation for a_max:\n   a_max = (0.1 m)(4",

During transcription, a section of DNA is unwound, and an enzyme called RNA polymerase reads the template strand of DNA.

This chain is complementary to the template DNA strand and is called the primary transcript.\n\n**Step 3: Processing of mRNA**\nAfter transcription, the primary transcript undergoes processing to become mature mRNA. This involves several steps, including:\n\n* Splicing: removing non-coding regions (introns) and joining coding regions (exons) together.\n* Addition of a 5' cap: adding a modified guanine nucleotide to the 5' end of the mRNA to protect it from degradation.\n* Addition of a poly-A tail: adding a long sequence of adenine nucleotides to the 3' end of the mRNA to help stabilize it.\n\n**Step 4: Translation**\nNow that we have mature mRNA,",
        "To explain the role of mRNA in protein synthesis, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Introduction to mRNA**\n\nmRNA stands for messenger RNA, a type of RNA molecule that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. mRNA is synthesized in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (cells with a true nucleus) through a process called transcription.\n\n**Step 2: Transcription**\n\nDuring transcription, a segment of DNA is used as a template to synthesize a complementary RNA molecule. This RNA molecule is called messenger RNA (mRNA). The process of transcription is initiated when an enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to the DNA template and begins to synthesize the mRNA molecule.\n\n**Step 3: mRNA Structure**\n\nThe mRNA molecule has several key features that are important for protein synthesis:\n\n* **5' cap**: A modified nucleotide that is added to the 5' end of the mRNA molecule to protect it from degradation.\n* **Coding region**: The sequence of nucleotides that codes for the amino acid sequence of the protein.\n* **3' poly-A tail**: A sequence of adenine nucleotides that is added to the 3' end of the mRNA molecule to stabilize it.\n\n**Step 4: Translation**\n\nOnce the mRNA molecule is synthesized, it is transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where it is translated into a protein. Translation occurs on structures called ribosomes, which are composed of two subunits: the"

        "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the concept of heterozygotes.**\nHeterozygotes are individuals that have two different alleles of a gene, one inherited from each parent. For example, if we consider a gene with two alleles, \"A\" and \"a\", a heterozygote would have the genotype \"Aa\".\n\n**Step 2: Understand the concept of selection favoring heterozygotes.**\nWhen selection favors heterozygotes, it means that individuals with two different alleles of a gene (heterozygotes) have a higher fitness or reproductive advantage compared to individuals with two copies of the same allele (homozygotes).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the type of selection.**\nThere are several types of selection, including directional selection, stabilizing selection, disruptive selection, and balancing selection. When selection favors heterozygotes, it is an example of **balancing selection**, also known as **heterozygote advantage**.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the answer.**\nTo confirm that balancing selection is the correct answer, let's consider the other types of selection:\n\n* Directional selection favors one extreme of a trait, which is not the case here.\n* Stabilizing selection favors the average or intermediate value of a trait, which is also not the case here.\n* Disruptive selection favors both extremes of a trait, which is not",
