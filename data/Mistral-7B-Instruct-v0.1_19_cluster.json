        "\n\nTo find the pH of a solution, we use the formula:\n\npH = -log10[H+]\n\nwhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter (M).\n\nIn this case, the concentration of hydrogen ions is 0.01 M. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\npH = -log10(0.01)\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can simplify this expression as follows:\n\npH = -(-1 * log10(10))\n\nSince log10(10) = 1, the equation becomes:\n\npH = 1 * (-1)\n\npH = -1\n\nSo, the pH of a 0.01 M HCl solution is -1. This means that the solution is acidic, as a pH below 7 indicates acidity."
