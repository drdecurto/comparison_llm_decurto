        " Step 1: Express one variable in terms of the other using the constraint equation.\nWe are given the constraint equation x + 2y = 10. We can express x in terms of y as follows:\n\nx = 10 - 2y\n\nStep 2: Substitute the expression for x into the objective function.\nThe objective function is C = 3x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2. We substitute the expression for x from Step 1 into the objective function:\n\nC = 3(10 - 2y)\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2\n\nStep 3: Simplify the objective function.\nNow we need to expand and simplify the expression for C:\n\nC = 3(100 - 40y + 4y\u00b2) + 4y\u00b2\nC = 300 - 120y + 12y\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2\nC = 300 - 120y + 16y\u00b2\n\nStep 4: Find the derivative of the objective function with respect to y.\nTo minimize the objective function, we need to find its critical points. We do this by taking the derivative of C with respect to y and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndC/dy = -120 + 32y\n\nStep 5: Solve for y",
        " To solve this problem, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We want to minimize the function C(x, y) = 3x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2 subject to the constraint g(x, y) = x + 2y - 10 = 0.\n\nStep 1: Define the Lagrangian function\nThe Lagrangian function is given by L(x, y, \u03bb) = C(x, y) + \u03bbg(x, y), where \u03bb is the Lagrange multiplier. In this case, we have:\n\nL(x, y, \u03bb) = 3x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2 + \u03bb(x + 2y - 10)\n\nStep 2: Compute the partial derivatives\nWe need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, and \u03bb, and set them equal to zero:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 6x + \u03bb = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202y = 8y + 2\u03bb = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03bb = x + 2y - 10 = 0\n\nStep 3: Solve the system of equations\nNow we have a system of three equations with three unknowns (x, y, and \u03bb). We can solve this system to find the values of x",
