        " To find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by y = x\u00b2, y = 0, and x = 2 around the y-axis, we can use the method of cylindrical shells. The formula for the volume of a solid using cylindrical shells is given by:\n\nV = 2\u03c0 \u222b[a, b] x * f(x) dx\n\nwhere f(x) is the function being rotated, and [a, b] is the interval of integration.\n\nStep 1: Identify the function and interval\nIn this case, f(x) = x\u00b2 and the interval is [0, 2] since we are given that x goes from 0 to 2.\n\nStep 2: Set up the integral\nWe will integrate with respect to x, so we have:\n\nV = 2\u03c0 \u222b[0, 2] x * (x\u00b2) dx\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the integral\nFirst, simplify the integrand:\n\nV = 2\u03c0 \u222b[0, 2] x\u00b3 dx\n\nNow, find the antiderivative of x\u00b3:\n\n(1/4)x\u2074\n\nEvaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of integration:\n\n(1/4)(2\u2074) - (1/4)(0\u2074)",
        " To find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by y = x\u00b2, y = 0, and x = 2 around the y-axis, we can use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of circular disks along the axis of rotation.\n\nStep 1: Express x in terms of y\nSince y = x\u00b2, we can rewrite it as x = sqrt(y).\n\nStep 2: Determine the limits of integration\nThe region is bounded by y = 0 and y = (2)^2 = 4. So, our limits of integration are from y = 0 to y = 4.\n\nStep 3: Set up the integral\nThe area of a disk is given by A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius of the disk. In this case, the radius is equal to x, which we have expressed in terms of y as sqrt(y). So, the area of a disk is A = \u03c0(sqrt(y))^2 = \u03c0y.\n\nNow, we integrate the area of the disks along the y-axis from y = 0 to y = 4:\n\nV = \u222b[from y=0 to y=4] \u03c0y dy\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the integral\nTo evaluate the integral, we find the antiderivative of \u03c0",
