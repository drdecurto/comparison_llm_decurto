        "To determine the type of selection that favors heterozygotes in a population, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of Selection Types:**\n    *   **Directional Selection:** Favors one extreme phenotype (and thus one allele) over others, leading to a shift in the allele frequency in one direction.\n    *   **Stabilizing Selection:** Favors the average or intermediate phenotype, selecting against both extremes. This reduces variation but maintains the mean.\n    *   **Disruptive (or Diversifying) Selection:** Favors both extreme phenotypes over the intermediate ones, potentially leading to a bimodal distribution of traits.\n    *   **Balancing Selection:** Any form of selection where multiple alleles are actively maintained in the gene pool at frequencies higher than would be expected by chance alone. This includes heterozygote advantage, frequency-dependent selection, and selection that varies in space or time.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:** The problem states that \"selection favors heterozygotes.\" This means individuals with two different alleles at a particular gene locus (e.g., Aa) have a higher fitness (survival and/or reproductive success) than individuals who are homozygous (e.g., AA or aa).\n\n3.  **Relate the Information to Selection Types:**\n    *   If heterozygotes have the highest fitness, then neither of the homozygous genotypes (representing the",
        "Let's solve this problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: Understand the question\nThe question is asking about a specific type of natural selection where heterozygotes (individuals with two different alleles for a particular gene) have a selective advantage over homozygotes (individuals with two identical alleles for a particular gene).\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of selection\nIn this scenario, where heterozygotes are favored, the type of selection is called \"heterozygote advantage\" or \"balancing selection.\"\n\nStep 3: Explain the concept\nHeterozygote advantage occurs when the heterozygous genotype has a higher fitness than either of the homozygous genotypes. This means that individuals with one copy of each allele (heterozygotes) have a better chance of surviving and reproducing than individuals with two copies of the same allele (homozygotes).\n\nStep 4: Provide an example\nA classic example of heterozygote advantage is sickle cell anemia in humans. Individuals who are heterozygous for the sickle cell allele (HbAS) have a higher resistance to malaria compared to individuals who are homozygous for either the normal allele (HbAA) or the sickle cell allele (HbSS). This results in a higher fitness for heterozygotes in regions where malaria is prevalent.\n\nTherefore, when selection favors heterozygotes, it is called heterozy"
