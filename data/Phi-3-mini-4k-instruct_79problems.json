The formula for the volume of a cylindrical shell is V = 2\u03c0rh, where r is the radius and h is the height of the shell.\n\nIn this case, the radius of the shell is x, and the height of the shell is given by the function y = x\u00b2. We will integrate with respect to x from 0 to 2.\n\nV = \u222b[2\u03c0rh] dx from 0 to 2\nV = \u222b[2\u03c0x(x\u00b2)] dx from 0 to 2\n\nNow, we will integrate the function:\n\nV = 2\u03c0 \u222b[x\u00b3] dx from 0 to 2\nV = 2\u03c0[x\u2074/4] from 0 to 2\n\nNow, we will evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nV = 2\u03c0[(2\u2074/4) - (0\u2074/4)]\nV = 2\u03c0[16/4]\nV = 2\u03c0[4]\n\nSo, the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by y = x\u00b2, y = 0, and x = ",
        "\n\n\n### Response:To find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by y = x\u00b2, y = 0, and x = 2 around the y-axis, we can use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of each infinitesimally small disk along the axis of rotation.\n\nFirst, we need to express x in terms of y, since we are rotating around the y-axis. From the equation y = x\u00b2, we have x = \u221ay.\n\nNow, we can set up the integral for the volume using the disk method:\n\nVolume = \u03c0 * \u222b[a, b] (radius of disk)^2 dy\n\nIn this case, the limits of integration are from y = 0 to y = 4 (since x = 2 and y = x\u00b2 => y = 2\u00b2 = 4). The radius of each disk is the x-coordinate, which is \u221ay.\n\nVolume = \u03c0 * \u222b[0, 4] (\u221ay)^2 dy\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nVolume = \u03c0 * \u222b[0, 4] y dy\n\nTo integrate, we use the power rule:\n\n\u222b y dy = (1/2)y^2 + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral with the limits of integration:"

The O allele is recessive, so an individual will only have blood type O if they inherit two O alleles.\n\nThe parents have genotypes AO and BO.

Transcription: The first step in protein synthesis is transcription, where a segment of DNA is used as a template to create a complementary mRNA strand. This occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.\n\n\n2. mRNA Processing: Once the mRNA strand is synthesized, it undergoes processing. This includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail, which protect the mRNA from degradation and help it exit the nucleus. Introns (non-coding regions) are spliced out, and exons (coding regions) are joined together.\n\n\n3.

This process occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. An enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to a specific region of the DNA called the promoter.

Processing: The primary mRNA transcript, also known as pre-mRNA, undergoes several modifications before it becomes mature mRNA. These modifications include the addition of a 5' cap, splicing to remove non-coding regions called introns, and the addition of a poly-A tail at the 3' end. These changes protect the mRNA from degradation and help it to be recognized by the ribosome during translation.\n\n\n",

        "\n\n\n### Response:\nTo solve this problem, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's introduce a new variable \u03bb (lambda) which is the Lagrange multiplier. We will form the Lagrangian function L(x, y, \u03bb) as follows:\n\nL(x, y, \u03bb) = 3x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2 + \u03bb(10 - x - 2y)\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, and \u03bb, and set them equal to zero:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 6x - \u03bb = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202y = 8y - 2\u03bb = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03bb = 10 - x - 2y = 0\n\nNow, we have a system of three equations with three unknowns (x, y, and \u03bb). We can solve this system step by step:\n\n1. From the first equation, we get \u03bb = 6x.\n2. Substitute \u03bb in the second equation: 8y - 2(6x) = 0 => 8y - 12x = 0 => 4y = 6x => y = (3/2)x\n3. Substitute y in the third equation",
