Recall the relationship between pH and the concentration of H+ ions: The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the concentration of H+ ions in moles per liter (M). Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\n   pH = -log10[H+]\n\n3. Calculate the concentration of H+ ions: Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely in water, meaning that the concentration of H+ ions is equal to the concentration of HCl. Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions in the 0.01 M HCl solution is also 0.01 M.\n\n4. Calculate the pH: Now that we have the concentration of H+ ions, we can calculate the pH using the formula:\n\n   pH = -log10[H+]\n\n   pH = -log10(0.01)\n\n   pH = 2\n\nSo, the pH of the 0.01 M HCl solution is 2.",
