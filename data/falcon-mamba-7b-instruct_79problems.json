We can use the following formula to calculate acceleration:\n\nAcceleration (a) = (Final velocity (v) - Initial velocity (u)) / Time (t)\n\nHowever, we are not given the initial velocity (u) or the time (t) in the problem. Instead, we are given the final velocity (v) and the distance (s) the car travels. We can use another formula to find the acceleration, which is:\n\nAcceleration (a) = Final velocity (v) / Time (t)\n\nFirst, we need to find the time (t) it takes for the car to accelerate from rest to 30 m/s. We can use the following formula to find the time:\n\nFinal velocity (v) = Initial velocity (u) + (Acceleration (a) * Time (t))\n\nSince the initial velocity (u) is 0 m/s (the car starts from rest), the formula becomes:\n\n30 m/s = 0 m/s + (a * t)\n\nNow, we can solve for time (t):\n\nt = 30 m/s / 0 m/s\n\nSince",
        "To solve this problem, we need to use the following equation:\n\nv^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere:\nv = final velocity (30 m/s)\nu = initial velocity (0 m/s, since the car starts from rest)\na = acceleration\ns = distance (100 m)\n\nWe are given the final velocity (v) and the distance (s), and we need to find the acceleration (a). We can rearrange the equation to solve for a:\n\na = (v^2 - u^2) / (2s)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\na = (30^2 - 0^2) / (2 * 100)\n\na = (900 - 0) / 200\n\na = 900 / 200\n\na = 4.5 m/s^2\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car is 4.5 m/s^2."

        "\nmRNA, or messenger RNA, plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, which is the process by which cells produce proteins. The role of mRNA in this process can be explained in several steps:\n\n1. Transcription: The first step in protein synthesis is transcription, which occurs in the cell nucleus. During transcription, the DNA sequence of a gene is copied into a complementary RNA sequence by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. This RNA sequence is called pre-mRNA, or primary transcript.\n\n2. Processing of pre-mRNA: After transcription, the pre-mRNA undergoes several processing steps to become a mature mRNA molecule. These steps include the addition of a 5' cap, which protects the mRNA from degradation, and a poly-A tail, which helps the mRNA to be transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. Additionally, introns, which are non-coding sequences within the pre-mRNA, are removed by a process called splicing, and the remaining exons are joined together to form the mature mRNA molecule.\n\n3. Translation: The mature mRNA molecule is then transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where it binds to ribosomes, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis. The ribosome reads the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA, translating it into a sequence of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.\n\n4.

        "\nTo solve this problem step by step, we need to understand the different types of natural selection and how they affect the frequency of different genotypes in a population.\n\n1. First, let's define the types of natural selection:\n   - Directional selection: This type of selection favors one extreme of a trait, causing the frequency of that extreme to increase over time.\n   - Stabilizing selection: This type of selection favors intermediate values of a trait, causing the frequency of extreme values to decrease over time.\n   - Disruptive selection: This type of selection favors both extreme values of a trait, causing the frequency of intermediate values to decrease over time.\n\n2. Now, let's consider the scenario where selection favors heterozygotes. Heterozygotes are individuals that have two different alleles for a particular gene. In this case, the selection is not directed towards any extreme value of the trait, but rather towards the heterozygous state.\n\n3. Based on the definition of the types of natural selection, this scenario falls under the category of disruptive selection. Disruptive selection favors both extreme values of a trait, which in this case are homozygous individuals with two copies of the same allele (either AA or aa).\n\n4. Therefore, the type of selection that favors heterozygotes is disruptive selection. This type of selection can lead to the coexistence of two distinct phenotypes in a population",
        "\nThe type of selection that favors heterozygotes is called heterozygote advantage or overdominance. This occurs when the heterozygous genotype (having two different alleles) is more fit than either homozygous genotype (having two identical alleles). This can result in the maintenance of genetic variation within a population, as individuals with different genotypes have a higher fitness than those with identical genotypes. Over time, this can lead to the evolution of new traits and the adaptation of populations to changing environments.",
        "1. Understand the question: The question is asking about the type of selection that favors heterozygotes in a population.\n\n2. Define key terms:\n   - Heterozygote: An organism that has two different alleles for a particular gene.\n   - Selection: The process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population over time, based on their impact on survival and reproduction.\n\n3. Identify the type of selection: There are three main types of selection:\n   a. Directional selection: This favors one extreme of a trait, causing the population to shift in that direction over time.\n   b. Stabilizing selection: This favors the intermediate values of a trait, reducing the frequency of both extreme values.\n   c. Disruptive selection: This favors both extremes of a trait, causing the population to split into two distinct groups.\n\n4. Determine the correct type of selection: In this case, the question states that heterozygotes are favored. This means that having two different alleles for a particular gene is beneficial for survival and reproduction. This type of selection is called heterozygote advantage or overdominance.\n\n5. Answer the question: The type of selection that favors heterozygotes is heterozygote advantage or overdominance."
