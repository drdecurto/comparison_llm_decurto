Here, I'll demonstrate using both methods.\n\n### Method 1: Cylindrical Shells\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) using the cylindrical shells method is given by:\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\int_{a}^{b} x f(x) \\, dx \\]\n\nFor our problem, \\(f(x) = x^2\\), and the limits of integration are from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 2\\). Thus,\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} x \\cdot x^2 \\, dx \\]\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} x^3 \\, dx \\]\n\nNow, integrate:\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\left[ \\frac{x^4}{4} \\right]_0^2 \\]\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{2^4}{4} - \\frac{0^4}{4} \\right) \\]\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{16}{4} \\right) \\]\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\cdot 4 \\",
        " To find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by \\(y = x^2\\), \\(y = 0\\), and \\(x = 2\\) around the y-axis, we can use the method of cylindrical shells. The formula for the volume using cylindrical shells is:\n\n\\[V = 2\\pi \\int_{a}^{b} x f(x) \\, dx\\]\n\nwhere \\(f(x)\\) is the height of the shell, and \\(x\\) is the radius of the shell.\n\nIn this case, \\(f(x) = x^2\\) (since \\(y = x^2\\)), and the limits of integration are from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 2\\).\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[V = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} x \\cdot x^2 \\, dx\\]\n\\[V = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} x^3 \\, dx\\]\n\nNow, we integrate:\n\n\\[V = 2\\pi \\left[\\frac{x^4}{4}\\right]_{0}^{2}\\]\n\nEvaluate the definite integral at the limits:\n\n\\[V = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{2^4}{4} - \\frac{0^4}{4}\\right)\\]\n\\[V = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{16}{4}\\right)\\]\n\\[V =",
