        "\n\n\n### Answer:To find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by y = x\u00b2, y = 0, and x = 2 around the y-axis, we can use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of infinitesimally thin disks along the axis of rotation.\n\nFirst, we need to express x in terms of y since we are rotating around the y-axis. From the equation y = x\u00b2, we get x = \u221ay.\n\nNow, we will set up the integral using the disk method. The area of each disk is given by A(y) = \u03c0 * (radius)^2, where the radius is the distance from the y-axis to the curve x = \u221ay. In this case, the radius is \u221ay.\n\nSo, A(y) = \u03c0 * (\u221ay)^2 = \u03c0 * y\n\nNow, we need to integrate A(y) with respect to y from the lower bound (y = 0) to the upper bound (y = 4, since x = 2 and y = x\u00b2 => y = 2\u00b2 = 4).\n\n\u222b[0, 4] \u03c0 * y dy\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the power rule for integration:\n\n\u222b y dy = (1/2) * y^",

The disk method involves integrating the area of each infinitesimally small disk along the axis of rotation.\n\nFirst, we need to express x in terms of y since we are rotating around the y-axis. From the equation y = x\u00b2, we can write x as a function of y: x = \u221ay.\n\nNow, we can set up the integral to find the volume. The area of each disk is given by A(y) = \u03c0 * (radius)^2, where the radius is the distance from the y-axis to the curve x = \u221ay. In this case, the radius is just x, so A(y) = \u03c0 * (\u221ay)^2 = \u03c0y.\n\nThe limits of integration are the y-values where the region starts and ends. When x = 0, y = 0, and when x = 2, y = 2\u00b2 = 4. So, the limits of integration are from y = 0 to y = 4.\n\nNow we can set up the integral:\n\nVolume = \u222b[A(y) dy] from y = 0 to y = 4",
