We will use the acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.8 m/s\u00b2) to solve this problem.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the relevant equation\nThe equation to find the maximum height (h) reached by an object under the sole influence of gravity is given by the equation: h = v\u2080\u00b2 / (2 * g), where v\u2080 is the initial velocity and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n## Step 3: Plug in the values\nWe are given the initial velocity (v\u2080 = 20 m/s) and the acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.8 m/s\u00b2). We will substitute these values into the equation to find the maximum height.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the calculation\nSubstituting the given values into the equation, we get: h = (20 m/s)\u00b2 / (2 * 9.8 m/s\u00b2) = 400 m\u00b2/s\u00b2 / 19.6 m/s\u00b2 = 20.4 m.\n\n## Step 5: Round the answer\nSince the answer should be a final number, we round the calculated value to the nearest whole number or to a reasonable number of decimal places if necessary.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20.4}$ ##"

Let x be the width of the enclosure and y be the length. The perimeter of the enclosure (excluding the side along the river) is given by P = 2x + y, and the total length of fencing available is 100 meters. Therefore, we can write the equation 2x + y = 100.\n\n## Step 2: Express y in terms of x\nTo simplify the problem and express the area in terms of a single variable, we can solve the equation 2x + y = 100 for y. This gives us y = 100 - 2x.\n\n## Step 3: Express the area in terms of x\nThe area of the rectangle is given by A = xy.

The objective is to maximize the area of the enclosure.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the constraints\nThe constraint is that the total length of fencing is 100 meters. Since the river requires no fencing, the total length of fencing will be used for the two lengths and two widths of the rectangular enclosure.\n\n## Step 3: Express the constraint mathematically\nLet x be the length of the enclosure and y be the width. Since the total length of fencing is 100 meters, we can express the constraint as 2x + 2y = 100.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the constraint\nDivide both sides of the equation by 2 to simplify the constraint: x + y = 50.\n\n## Step 5: Express the area in terms of one variable\nThe area of the rectangle is given by A = xy.

If the original price is 100, a 20% increase would be 100 + (100 * 0.20) = 120.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the decrease in stock price\nNext, we calculate the decrease in the stock price when it goes down by 15% from the increased price of 120. A 15% decrease from 120 would be 120 - (120 * 0.15) = 102.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the overall percentage change\nTo find the overall percentage change, we compare the final price to the original price. The original price was 100, and the final price after the increase and decrease is 102. The overall percentage change is calculated as ((final price - original price) / original price) * 100 = ((102 - 100) / 100) * 100 = 2%.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$ ## Step 1: Calculate the increase in stock price\nFirst, we need to calculate the increase in the stock price when it goes up by 20%.

This is done by dividing the number of patients who showed improvement (270) by the total number of patients in the clinical trial (300).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the standard error\nNext, we need to calculate the standard error of the proportion. The formula for the standard error of the proportion is sqrt(p*(1-p)/n), where p is the sample proportion and n is the total number of patients.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the critical value for the confidence interval\nFor a 95% confidence interval, we need to determine the critical value from the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution).

First, calculate the sample proportion p\u0302. p\u0302 = 270 / 300 = 0.9. Next, calculate the standard error of the proportion. SE = \u221a(p\u0302 * (1-p\u0302) / n) = \u221a(0.9 * 0.1 / 300) = \u221a(0.009 / 300) = \u221a0.00003 = 0.005. Now, find the z-score corresponding to the 95% confidence level. The z-score for 95% confidence is approximately 1.96. Finally, calculate the margin of error. Margin of error = z * SE = 1.96 * 0.005 = 0.0098. Now, calculate the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval. Lower bound = p\u0302 - margin of error = 0.9 - 0.0098 = 0.8902. Upper bound = p\u0302 + margin of error = 0.9 + 0.0098 = 0.9098.
